# CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates a **CI/CD pipeline** using **Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub Actions** to automate builds, testing, and deployment.

## 🚀 Features
- **Continuous Integration** with GitHub Actions
- **Containerized Builds** using Docker
- **Automated Deployment** via Jenkins
- **GitHub Webhooks** for triggering builds

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions
